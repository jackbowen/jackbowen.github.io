      <p class="projectDescription">Hydroponics is a set of techniques for growing plants without the use of any soil. Instead, plants' roots are exposed directly to nutrient-enriched water. Using these methods, fresh organic produce can be available year round from nearby greenhouses or indoor farms. These farms can stack trays of hydroponic crops on top of each other, allowing for a much higher yield per acre. They use 90% less water than traditional, soil-grown methods and the fact that they are local greatly reduces the carbon emissions from transporting and storing crops. A large, up-front investment required to start these operations is the main bottleneck preventing them from greater ubiquity.</p>

      <p class="projectDescription">Many consumers and hobbyists, unsatisfied with their current selection of produce or simply wanting to experiment at home, are starting their own miniaturized set-ups. Once up and running, these systems involve a variety of factors that are invisible to the naked eye and greatly contribute to the overall health of the plants. This is where FreshBytes comes in. FreshBytes is a hydroponic monitoring and control system that demystifies the intangibles that arise when farming without soil. It collects all of the measurements that you aren't able to perceive, displays the data in an easily configurable interface, and allows you to control a system's electronic components based on that data.</p>

      <p class="projectDescription">Simply drop the probe into your reservoir and it will start recording a few key measurements. The electrical conductivity of the water measures the amount of nutrients present within it. The water’s pH affects how the plant is able to absorb those nutrients. Furthermore, the correct amount of dissolved oxygen helps regulate the availability of those nutrients as well as stave off anaerobic diseases. The temperature affects the water’s dissolved oxygen and can harm the plant if it’s too high or too low. Freshbytes aggregates all of this info while providing recommendations for healthy ranges of these values.</p>

      <p class="projectDescription">Every hydroponic set-up differs so FreshBytes is designed to be as configurable as possible.</p>
