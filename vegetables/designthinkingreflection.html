        <h1>Design Thinking Final Reflections</h1>
        <h4>Jack Bowen - Fall 2021</h4>

        <p>The original design question for our team was “How can we implement more sustainable ways to deposit single-use masks for Seattle and Bellevue grocery store shoppers when they are done with shopping in order to reduce local litter?” The impetus for this question was personal, we had simply observed a decent amount of mask litter within our environment. I don’t think it’s wrong to focus on a design question whose origins are so anecdotal but it did have the potential to give us tunnel vision throughout the process. My other team members, Minjee and Xiaoyang (who also goes by Sven) are comfortable working across multiple domains so our team did not have rigidly defined roles such as designer, engineer, or product manager. Our roles were only able to be delineated in hindsight and could best be split up into the theoretical framework from which we approached problems. Minjee was the dreamer, Sven was the refiner, and I was the pragmatist. I’ll expand upon these roles throughout the explanation of our process.</p>

        <h2>Primary Research</h2>
        <p>Because our original design question was so specific and recent, it was unsurprisingly difficult to find secondary research that was directly connected to it. The info that was directly related came in the form of news articles, soundbytes, first-hand witnesses, et cetera. To find any peer-reviewed studies within this domain, we had to expand upon what we considered to be relevant and then calibrate our understanding of that info based on how closely it was actually related to our design question. For example, we found peer reviewed studies for mask litter in places like London and Melbourne. How would we translate those findings into our local context? Melbourne has more similar demographics in terms of population, density, and driving habits but London has more similar weather patterns that could affect the degradation of the masks over time (an important factor if you’re considering how to collect littered ones).</p>
        
        <h2>Secondary Research</h2>
        <p>Our field study was probably the most important step in determining the overall direction our project would take. We went to a few different grocery store parking lots throughout the county. We wanted to understand our users’ in context, uncovering their needs and pain points. To do this, we needed to observe their overall relationships with their masks.</p>
        <img src="vegetable_resources/FieldStudy.jpg">
        <p>We each developed our own system in order to efficiently collect data on where shoppers applied or removed their masks. My system involved quickly sketching the entrance of the store, and then using multiple sheets of trace paper to track shoppers over 10 minute intervals. Each of our systems worked relatively well and played to our strengths. I’m more comfortable with pen and paper than digital tools so my method allowed me the time I needed to write down any unexpected observations. During this study, we didn’t see anyone litter a mask. In hindsight this was probably to be expected. There were, on average, between 4 and 5 littered masks at each of our locations. I ended up carrying out observations for about 45 minutes. If I had seen a mask get littered during this timeframe, one could deduce that 32 masks would get littered over a 24 hour period. In actuality it would be less because the store closes for a number of hours and customer traffic ebbs and flows but the principle still stands. We didn’t really consider the expected frequency of the event we were trying to witness when determining the duration of our field study. From this point on, we started to consider transitioning away from just litter in favor of considering the repurposing of masks as a whole. Part of the reason for this is to better service the high number of single-use mask wearers who either continued to wear their masks as they left the premises or disposed of them properly. A more honest reason for this change was to simplify the quantifying and validating that would arise in the later steps of the design thinking process. If we stuck with mask litter, there would be too many variables to account for. For example, if we were to measure the effectiveness of a litter-focused prototype, the time scale over which our validation would have taken place would have been too long to observe. If we implemented collecting data within an environment before and after our intervention, how could we be sure that any changes in the distribution of litter were correlated to our prototype and not a weekly clean up crew that had swept through or an event that caused higher than normal foot traffic? I think this is one of the first violences of design thinking. When one is aware of the laundry list of deliverables they are going to generate, it really informs and directs the scope of feasible design questions.</p>
        
        <p>Our survey was designed in such a way that it would be relevant if we were to continue down a litter-focused path but also provide some insights if we were to switch to a broader recycling program. I brought up the point that very few respondents would admit an act considered shameful by society, littering, so we would be better served by teasing out more general feelings toward masks.</p>
